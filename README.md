I am going to create a website that connects users of different games to one another.
Going to focus more on the front end for this project.

Technologies used: Django backend with angular front end, HTML5/CSS3.

Features: 
  Using a gaming API (or creating one with kimono or import.IO), going to import a list of cell phone games(if time allows will extend this list to computer and platform games)

  Ability to make posts looking for others to play a specific game with you, or to make a post looking for party and game (In search of more/in search of party)

  Searching functionality to allow a better flow through the site.
